Once there, it can be carried by the currents for many years and travel thousands of kilometers. Some of it is eaten by marine wildlife and enters the food chain. As a result, thousands of pieces of marine plastic are consumed by humans each year when they eat fish and other seafood. However, most of the plastic in the seas and oceans eventually washes up on beaches. Nowhere on Earth has as much plastic as the beaches of Henderson Island in the South Pacific. The remote island is the most polluted anywhere in the world, and 99.8 percent of this pollution is plastic. The island’s beaches contain around 38 million pieces of plastic; most of this is from everyday consumer goods."

If we do this, we will reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in our oceans and on our beaches. We will also be less likely to find plastic returning to us on our dinner plates."
