						"Winters in Denmark are long, dark and cold, but according to the 2016 ON World Happiness Report, Danish people are among the happiest in the world. One reason might be hygge, the Danish attitude that focuses on enjoying the simple things in life, such as enjoying a coffee in a relaxed atmosphere with easy-going friends or family."

						"Your friends come over on a cold winter evening to sit by the fire, eat homemade food and play board games. That's definitely hygge. You have a quiet night in, take a bath, light some candles, then sit down with a good book and a cozy blanket. That's hygge, too. You argue about politics, check your phone, play video games and listen to thumping techno music. That's definitely not hygge! So how do you know if it's hygge? Think warm socks, wool sweaters, sleeping pets and happy family gatherings. Got it now?"

						"Research shows that people who are kind to themselves and take some time to relax and enjoy the simple things in life are happier. Hygge encourages us to do this and also to get together with friends and family. Happy groups of people make more caring communities and a happier society. Itâ€™s no surprise that the Danes are always smiling!"
