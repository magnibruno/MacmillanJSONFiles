But when I lived in Spain, my brain had two words to choose from, dog and perro (and yes, that's dog in Spanish!). My brain learned to block the wrong word - it blocked dog when I was speaking Spanish and perro when I was speaking English. Over time, my brain got very good at blocking words."

As quickly as possible, say what color they're written in. Try it now. Did you notice how hard it was to say the color when the word itself was a color? That’s because ‘bad information’ (the word on the page) blocked the ‘good information’ (the color of the word)."

It turns out that bilingual people are much better at activities like this than monolingual people, because their brains are trained to block ‘bad information’ quickly and accurately. And in the modern world, where we have to deal with too much information all the time, the ability to block ‘bad information’ is the key to success."
