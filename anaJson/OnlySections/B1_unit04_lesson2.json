In Japan, companies such as car maker Toyota have found that working shorter hours leads to happier employees, and higher profits."

This means your robot might be able to figure out if you are happy or sad and use this information to talk and behave like a friend. That could make it possible for robots to take care of people. Some experts even believe that one day it may be possible for robots to feel love."
