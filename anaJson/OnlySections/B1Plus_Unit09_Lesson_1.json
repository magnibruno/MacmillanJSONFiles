						"For most people, going to the theater is a chance to relax and let the actors do all the work. But in recent years, a new type of theater has appeared where the audience takes part in the play! When it works well, immersive theater can be breathtaking. But when it goes wrong, it can be awful. Here are my six recommendations based on my favorite (and least favorite!) immersive plays."

						"Sometimes the building itself is part of the experience. A good example is Hotel Impossible, which took place in a real hotel building. Similarly, The Dark Tunnels took place inside real tunnels, which created a very scary atmosphere. However, a great location isn’t everything. Dangerous Heart was in a beautiful palace, but the play didn’t really take advantage of the space."

						"In Step by Step, the audience was limited to 15, so we could interact one-on-one with the characters. During the play, the audience had to solve a crime, so we really had to pay attention to what we saw and heard. By the end, I was terrified and exhausted, but it was an unforgettable experience."

						"Some immersive plays feel far too complicated, with too many characters and storylines. For example, Yellow and Blue had amazing special effects, but I couldn’t keep track of who was who. In The Quiet Visitors, however, there were only six characters in a large empty room. We had to use our imaginations, and the effect was incredibly powerful."

						"The worst thing about immersive theater? Other members of the audience! The play Life with the Lions got rid of this problem by making the audience wear animal costumes. I felt silly in my zebra costume, but at least we couldn’t tell the difference between actors and spectators. In The Dark Tunnels, we all wore black clothes and masks so the members of the audience were almost invisible to each other."

					"paragraphContents": [
						"Without a strong story, immersive theater can easily fall flat – it feels like something’s missing. In Hotel Impossible, for example, lots of interesting things happened, but the whole play didn’t really go anywhere. In The Quiet Visitors, however, there was a clear beginning, a middle … and a shocking surprise at the end."

						"It isn’t just about what the audience sees and hears. The best immersive plays make use of the senses of taste, smell and touch, too. In Dangerous Heart, we enjoyed a delicious meal as part of the experience. Similarly, in The Dark Tunnels, the unpleasant underground smell added to the sense of danger. And in The Quiet Visitors, when the room suddenly went as cold as ice, the effect was terrifying."
