And instead of sitting quietly at separate tables, all the customers eat together, talking and making friends. But if that sounds like your perfect evening, there's some bad news. You can't just show up when you're feeling hungry; you'll need to join a waiting list and then wait for an invitation from the chef."

						"The modern idea of supper clubs took off in Cuba in the 1990s. Cuba now has a huge amount of supper clubs, or paladares. Most of them began their existence as simply a room in the chef's home. They're popular with tourists, as well as people who want a simple home-cooked meal at a fair price. One of Cuba's best paladares is Castas y Tal, on the 11th floor of a large apartment building in central Havana. The main restaurant area has only eight seats, but there are wonderful views of the city below."

						"For chefs, supper clubs clearly seem like a great idea. They're fairly cheap and easy to set up because the chef can do everything at home. Instead of having to cook the same food again and again, supper clubs give chefs control over what to cook. Customers don't mind giving up some choice because they know they'll eat amazing food that they've never eaten before. They might not like it, but at least it won't be boring."
