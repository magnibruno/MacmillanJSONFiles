But for most people, the number 70 acts as a hook. It encourages us to think of a number that isn't too far from 70. But if the hook number had been much higher, say 70 million, it would have made us think of a number in the millions. And if we hadn't seen a hook at all, we might have chosen a more likely answer: around 70,000 thoughts per day."
