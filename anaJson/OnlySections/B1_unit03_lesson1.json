						"Hughes traveled by sea and over land to complete his record-breaking journey. He traveled on a budget of only US $150 a week and paid for everything himself. Thirty-three-year-old Hughes set off on New Year's Day 2009. His first stop was Argentina. And 1,492 days later, he arrived at his final destination, South Sudan. Hughes crossed the borders of all of the 193 United Nations countries. He traveled long distances by boat, and for shorter trips, went by train, rode a bus or occasionally took a taxi. None of his trips were by plane. A lot of people helped him on his journey. Some of them gave him directions and food, or let him sleep on their couch for free, and others gave him rides."

The most difficult place to get to was the Seychelles. Graham tried three times from three different countries before he finally made it to the islands."
