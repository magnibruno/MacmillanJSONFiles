						"I've never been the kind of person who does lots of exciting things in their free time. Paragliding, swimming with dolphins, climbing Mount Everest - not me! My idea of danger is to sit on the couch and watch the latest crime series on TV. The closest I get to nature is when I like my friends' cat pictures on social media. As for climbing Himalayan mountains - forget it! I'd rather climb the stairs to bed."

There are so many things out there - how do you know what you will enjoy? So I decided to spend the first six months of this year trying out a new hobby each month. I was a complete beginner at every activity I tried."

						"The first thing I learned was that no flies are harmed in fly fishing. You make a pretty, artificial fly and attach it to a hook on a fishing line. Then you throw the line on the water. When a fish takes a bite, you... oh, I don't know. I did NOT do well at this. One month: lots of badly made flies, and ZERO fish (apart from the ones I got at the fish and fries place on my way home)."

After only a month, I was already one of the best players in the group. I really can't believe it. Maybe there’s a chance for me to get in shape after all."

It wasn't dangerous and it wasn't painful. And at the end of the month, I could play Rivers of Babylon all the way through. If that isn't success, I don't know what is!"
