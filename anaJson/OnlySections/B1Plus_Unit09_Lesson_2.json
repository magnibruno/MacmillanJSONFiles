						"One day, I was invited to one of Gatsby’s parties. As soon as I arrived, I began to look for Gatsby to thank him for his invitation. But no one knew where he was. As I went to get a drink, I saw Jordan Baker. I walked toward her, glad to see someone I knew. ‘I thought you might be here,’ Jordan said. We took our drinks and sat down at a small table under a tree. Jordan began to talk to a girl in a yellow dress. ‘Do you come to these parties often?’ Jordan asked her. ‘I come when I can,’ the girl said. ‘No one cares what I do, so I always have a good time. Last time I was here, I tore my dress. Do you know, Gatsby sent me a new one! It cost him 265 dollars!’"

						"Supper was now being served. Jordan and I left our table and went to look for Gatsby. People were dancing now. The voices and the laughter were very loud. The moon was high in the sky. Jordan and I sat down at a table with a well-dressed man of my own age. I was enjoying myself, now. The music stopped for a moment. The man at our table looked at me and smiled. ‘I think I know your face,’ the man said. ‘Weren’t you in France during the War?’ ‘Yes, I was.’ ‘Me, too,’ he said. We talked about the War for a few minutes. Then the man told me that he had a new motorboat."

Gatsby sent me an invitation this morning. I ought to thank him.’ The man stared at me in surprise. ‘I’m Gatsby,’ he said. ‘I thought you knew, old sport. I’m not a very good host, am I?’ Gatsby smiled. He had a pleasant smile. His smile made me feel important. I looked at Gatsby with interest. He was a tough-looking young man, but he had beautiful clothes and beautiful manners."

						"A few guests were standing near Gatsby. I went up to him to say goodbye. ‘Don’t forget we’re going out in the boat, old sport,’ he said. ‘At nine o’clock.’ Gatsby smiled at me. ‘Goodnight, old sport, goodnight.’ I walked across the lawn in the moonlight. The cars drove away. The yard was quiet and empty. All alone, Gatsby stood on the white steps, waving goodbye."
