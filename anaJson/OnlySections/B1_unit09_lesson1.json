						"We live in a society that is obsessed with spending money - a society that is obsessed with materialism. When we buy things, it gives us happiness. But this feeling usually lasts only for a short time. Experiences, on the other hand, stay with us for a long time after they have finished. Therefore, if we spent more of our money on experiences, we would gain something that can last a lifetime. Here are three more reasons we should spend our money on experiences, we would gain something that can last a lifetime. Here are three more reasons we should spend more time and money on experiences and three people who agree with this advice."

We don't have to climb Mount Everest, but we can do things like learn to play a musical instrument, start a new sport or simply do something new for the first time. This will make us feel good and give us a sense of achievement. This will then inspire us to try more things in life. So, my attitude toward money is to spend it on experiences as much as possible!'"
