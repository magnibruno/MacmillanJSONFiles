						"Did anyone see that TV show last night? Is the internet killing our brains? It was really interesting. First, it looked at the human memory in the 21st century and at how the internet is destroying our memory. This is because today most information is instantly available online and we don't need to remember things. And it said that over time, this could have a negative effect on the brain's memory system - a case of use it or lose it. The show then focused on how the human attention span is decreasing. It said that the brain is naturally easily distracted, and on the internet there is a lot of opportunity for this distraction. Evidence suggests that this is negatively affecting our attention spans and our ability to concentrate."
