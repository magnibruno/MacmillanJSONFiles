						"I grew up in Canada with nature right on my doorstep. I just had to step outside and I could see all manner of mammals, reptiles, birds and amphibians. One day my older cousin, Julian, took me to see a grizzly fishing with her cub... from a safe distance, of course. Julian passed me his camera so that I could zoom in. It was great to watch them so closely, I never wanted to forget it. I pressed the shutter and that's when I decided what I wanted to do for the rest of my life."

						"Well... I love dogs... I have four at home. In terms of photography, though, orangutans, without a doubt. Their name literally means 'person of the forest' in Malay, and you can see why. It's not just their body language and facial expressions that are so like ours, but also their social interactions. Over my career, I've also taken a lot of photos of spiders, which you may not understand! But most people come to realize, like me, that up close they are unexpectedly fascinating."

						"Well some animals are so ‘seen’ there are hundreds of photographs of them … you know, elephants, eagles, tigers. It isn’t easy to take something amazing that everyone would be interested in. Certain types of monkeys are challenging too as they don’t want to make eye contact with people. Then there are lemurs which will look you in the eye, in fact they’ll climb all over you, but they live deep in the Madagascan rainforest. Habitats like that are hard to get to, especially carrying camera equipment."

					"paragraphSubtitles": null,
					"paragraphContents": [
						"Don’t rush out and spend a fortune on a new camera. It really isn’t the most important thing. An interest in animals is obvious but essential. Unless you are incredibly lucky, be prepared for uncomfortable hours or even weeks waiting for the perfect shot. Researching habitats and life cycles can certainly help this. If you watch an animal for long enough, you can predict its behavior. For example, I always know when a grizzly will swipe for the salmon and so I am there ready to capture the moment."
