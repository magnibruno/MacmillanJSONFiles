						"British brothers Rob and Paul Forkan have experienced tragedy and success in their short and unusual lives. When they were still children, their parents took them out of school in the UK and moved the family to India to travel and do charity work. The experience taught them about life in other places and made them confident and independent."

The giant wave killed their parents, but Rob (17), Paul (15) and their younger brother and sister survived. The children, now orphans, managed to hitchhike across Sri Lanka to the airport. From there, they flew back to Britain, where friends and family were waiting."

Customers love Gandys' stylish and fashionable designs and that the brothers give ten percent of the profits to their charity. In 2014, three years after Gandys began, Orphans for Orphans opened its first children's home in Sri Lanka."
