						"There are more than seven billion human beings living on Earth, and then there are a very special group of people who live somewhere completely different. Four hundred kilometers above us and circling the planet at 7.7 km per second, there are between six and ten astronauts who call the International Space Station (ISS) home. Since the first crew members arrived in November 2000, records confirm that over 200 people from 18 countries have visited the ISS. Many only need to stay for a short time, but others need to spend several months there. So, what is the average zero-gravity day like on the ISS?"

						"Living in space may seem exciting, but in fact, the daily routine is fairly repetitive. The crew needs to follow a detailed schedule. Days begin each morning at 6 am when, instead of an alarm clock, a different song chosen by the crew's families back on Earth is played to wake them up. As on Earth, the first stop is the bathroom. Keeping clean is difficult because without gravity, everything floats, including water. Residents of the ISS report that washing your hair is particularly difficult in space."

						"After a challenging start comes breakfast. Almost all the food on the ISS is either dried or canned. Most people would agree that the daily menu is not one of the highlights of life in space. Next, it's time to exercise. Research has shown that muscles and bones quickly become weak in space, so astronauts need to work out for at least two hours each day, using special zero-gravity gym equipment."

						"The ISS is a large floating laboratory and astronauts spend much of the day doing research. Crew members work with scientists on Earth to do experiments and collect data, usually about the effects of space travel on the mind and body. It is thought that one day humans will travel to Mars, so astronauts test new technologies and look for solutions to the challenges of spending large amounts of time in space."
