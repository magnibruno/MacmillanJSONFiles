However, digital tech companies have redesigned the office and provided unusual benefits to make the workplace a more pleasant and productive place to be. Need a massage to help reduce stress? Want to bring your pet to work? No problem. For these companies, the days of individual cubicles where people would work on their own for eight hours a day are no more."
