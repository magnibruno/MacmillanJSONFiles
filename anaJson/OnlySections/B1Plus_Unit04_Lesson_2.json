Despite this, Tetlock found that 2 percent of them were rather good at it – better than both monkeys and professional experts. These ‘super-forecasters’ are smart, but not geniuses. However, they do have good thinking skills that anyone can develop."

						"Super-forecasters are analytical thinkers who update their opinions when they get new information, and they don't let their personal hopes affect their thinking. More importantly, they listen carefully to different views that they then use in their forecast. This perhaps explains why they make their most accurate predictions when working in teams of super-forecasters."

They speak with great confidence, stressing they are totally certain: 'I'm sure all cars will be driverless,' 'Robots are going to replace office workers,' 'We won't have an early election.' This means they are great TV guests and bloggers, but not the best forecasters."

They also use percentages to show how likely something is: 'I think this has an 80 percent chance of happening.' In this way, the team can discuss different ideas easily and make a final prediction."
