						"You're planning to go on vacation and you've decided to try somewhere new. You could consider using a travel agent, but it's easy to organize your own vacation online these days. All you need to do is visit a travel review site, spend time reading travelers' comments and then choose the accommodations with the best reviews. Simple!"

						"Or is it? How do you know that what you are reading is genuine? Research shows that some hotels and restaurants pay people to write fake reviews. Of course, the websites manage to find and delete some of these fake reviews, but they aren't always successful. So, before you choose to spend your vacation budget or that 'amazing beach resort' or cruise ship that scored ten out of ten, read our tips and learn how to spot a fake review."

						"TIP ONE: What you see is not always what you get. If the pictures of the apartment, quest house or campsite seem to be too good to be true, they probably are. For example, when you see the photograph below, you expect to find a nice quiet beach, but in fact, the beach and all the hotels are right next to a building site!"

						"TIP TWO: Nowhere is perfect – fact! Most genuine reviewers like to include a mix of positive and negative comments, so a review that’s 100 percent positive or negative is more likely to be fake. If you want to know what a hostel or chalet is really like, don’t read the very best and very worst reviews. Look at the ones in the middle."

						"TIP THREE: EXCELLENT!!!! Fake reviewers like using capital letters, exclamation marks!! and lots of extreme adjectives like 'wonderful', 'amazing' and 'excellent'. It can feel like you are being YELLED AT! Genuine reviewers usually avoid using so much extreme language. Instead, they usually include helpful details like room size or prices."
