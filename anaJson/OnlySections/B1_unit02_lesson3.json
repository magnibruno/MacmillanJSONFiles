						"When I was young, the school summer vacation was six weeks long - it felt like forever. A year was such a long time! Now I'm an adult, time passes so quickly. Why does time seem to fly as we get older? Psychologists have several theories about this. Here are the most popular ones:"

					"paragraphSubtitles": null,
					"paragraphContents": [
						"The first theory is mathematical. When you were 5 years old, a year was 20 percent of your life, so it seemed like a long time. When you are 50 years old, a year is only 2 percent of your life, so it seems much shorter. Time can feel very different if you are a child or an adult."

					"paragraphSubtitles": null,
					"paragraphContents": [
						"As children, we didn't have as much to worry about. We started school and studied, then we came home and played with our friends. Adult life is fast, busy and stressful - it's difficult to do everything we want to do. Days can be tiring. Many of us feel that there isn't enough time in the day. Time seems to pass very quickly because as adults we tend to rush to do something and then move on to the next job with no time to stop and think."

					"paragraphSubtitles": null,
					"paragraphContents": [
						"As children, we knew exactly how many days it was until our next birthday or holiday. All that counting and waiting made the days seem to pass much more slowly. Some psychologists suggest adults don't notice time passing because they are focused on 'boring adult stuff', like shopping or housework. The days, weeks and months pass quickly. Suddenly, another year is over and a new one is beginning."

				{
					"paragraphOrdinal": 5,

					"paragraphSubtitles": null,
					"paragraphContents": [
						"The routines of work and family life mean that, for many adults, the days all feel the same. This is different from our early lives, which were full of exciting first-time experiences. Back then, we started school and studied new things. Then we took exams, went on our first dates and learned to drive. When we look back, much longer because so many new things happened."

					"paragraphSubtitles": null,
					"paragraphContents": [
						"All these theories have something in common: there is a clear difference between the way adults and children experience time. Perhaps we need to learn from children and slow down a little. Stop, look around, notice the blossom on the trees in the spring and the leaves changing color in the fall. The earth will keep spinning, but we are only here for a short time. Let's enjoy it."
