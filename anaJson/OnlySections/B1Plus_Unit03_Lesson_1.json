						"Using your cell phone. Putting on your headphones. Staring out of the window. Those are all classic ways to avoid talking to strangers on public transportation. However, this may not be the best thing to do for your well-being. Recent research by Nicholas Epley, a professor of behavioral science at the University of Chicago, and Juliana Schroeder, a PhD student, reveals that people are happier when they talk with other passengers rather than ignoring them."

						"The inspiration for the research came from Epley's own daily commute. Humans are, by nature, social animals, and being social is key to our happiness. However, the commuters that Epley saw every day were behaving in very antisocial ways, avoiding all communication as if they were sitting next to a rock. He wondered why nearly everyone acted against their social nature in this situation. Is talking to a stranger on a train truly less pleasant than sitting in silence? Or is everybody wrong?"

						"To find out, Epley and Schroeder designed two experiments. In the first, Epley simply asked people to imagine starting a conversation with another passenger. Would it be a pleasant thing to do? Would they feel happy afterward? In the second study, they asked commuters to actually start conversations with strangers on their trip, and then to complete a survey about the experience."

It also revealed that the reaction was positive because they all took part in the conversations, even though they were not aware it was an experiment."

						"Based on the findings, Epley feels that passenger cars filled with silence, blank expressions and little eye contact are the result of basic misunderstandings and false expectations. Despite what everyone thinks, strangers are happy to talk and talking makes you happier. Once people make the decision to start a conversation, they find this connection to others improves their own lives."

He no longer uses his cell phone and he starts conversations with opening lines as simple as 'I like your hat.' He regularly finds himself sitting next to someone he has talked to before, which just makes it more pleasant."
