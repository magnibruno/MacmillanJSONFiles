Not many small businesses achieve sales of $16,000 in their first months, and none have a product that is so cheap to produce. With plans to start marketing Aethaer in India, Watts could be made a millionaire by selling almost nothing, nothing but air."

The glass jars are held high in the air, and are closed after a few minutes. That's it - the simplest production process ever. Next, a label saying where the air comes from is put on the jar. Then, after they have been packed for delivery, they are sent overseas. Job done."

						"There are currently 15 different 'airs' in the product range. Watts claims that each one has different qualities depending on where they were collected. While some customers do buy the air to inhale, many people buy the jars as gifts that will be kept and won't be opened. Aethaer air is sold as a luxury item for wealthy people, but other new businesses have started selling cans of compressed air for everyday or sports use. Each can contains 200 breaths of air, and they come with a face mask for efficient and easy use."
