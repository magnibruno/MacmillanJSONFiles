This is changing the familiar format of TV series, and show-makers now can be much more creative. For example, shows usually include actual real-world events that are happening at the same time."

						"Budgets for this new generation of TV shows are high and the shows have huge international audiences. Consequently, a lot of Hollywood stars are moving away from making traditional theater movies and appearing more on TV. At the same time, binge-watching is replacing going to the movie theater as a social occasion, with friends getting together for an evening of television. You don’t actually need to be in the same physical place. Thanks to social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook, even watching alone can be a social event."

TV companies will therefore need to make more and more shows that meet this demand. As other media companies are starting to make their own TV shows, too, binge-watching will continue to be big business."
