						"Goji berries are another great source of plant-based protein. These sweet berries have been used in China for centuries as a way to protect against illness. They contain less sugar than other fruits, so they're one of the healthiest snacks around. Unfortunately, they can be dangerous for some people, so always check with your doctor before eating them."

						"Quinoa has a long history as a superfood: it was known to the ancient Incas as 'the mother of all grains' because it was so healthy. Even today it's recommended by NASA as the perfect food for long space flights. Like all whole grains, it can help your body fight a variety of diseases, and it contains lots of vitamins, minerals and fiber. It's also one of the best sources of protein, so it's perfect for vegetarians and vegans, too. Amazing!"

						"Acai berries are perhaps the most successful superfoods of all: not long ago, they were unknown outside of Brazil. Now, acai products are big business. Why are they so popular? Well, some people believe these berries will help them to grow old more slowly... or even to live longer. Like goji berries, they're full of chemicals which seem to protect our hearts and our brains. Sounds good, right?"

						"Chia seeds are known as the healthiest food on the planet. The name 'chia' comes from the ancient Mayan word for strength. Out of all the foods in the world, chia seeds contain some of the most nutrients for the fewest calories. They're also one of the best sources of fiber, which is great for your digestive system. Even better, they make you feel full... so you'll eat fewer snacks!"

						"But before you all rush out to buy superfoods from your local health food store, remember that superfoods are usually super expensive, too! And do you know what? Strawberries are probably just as good for you as goji berries and acai berries. Similarly, quinoa and chia seeds are great because they're whole grains. But you can get all that fiber far more cheaply by eating plenty of brown bread, brown rice and whole grain pasta. And what's the best superfood of all? Broccoli! It's cheap, tasty and incredibly good for you. It isn't as exciting as quinoa, but it's a lot less expensive!"
