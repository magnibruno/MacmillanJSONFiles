						"Everybody has their own style of handwriting, but can someone's handwriting tell you what they are like? The study of handwriting is called graphology. Graphologists are usually involved in legal cases. They are responsible for matching criminals to their handwriting or deciding if signatures are real. Some graphologists think handwriting can show anything: what kind of job you will be good at, how healthy you are and even what kind of partner you might be happy with. If you are interested in what your handwriting says about you, check out our information."
