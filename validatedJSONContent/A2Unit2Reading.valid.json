He’s one of my close friends now. I always laugh a lot when I’m with Erdem. I met a French guy named Nico at soccer practice. He’s really friendly, but very different from Erdem. He’s fairly quiet and serious. That’s the good news. The bad news is about my roommate. I only have one roommate. His name’s Erik. He’s quiet in the day and noisy in the middle of the night! He’s so unfriendly – he never speaks to me. And he’s really messy! I want to find a new place to live. I want to live with a happy, friendly and neat person!",
