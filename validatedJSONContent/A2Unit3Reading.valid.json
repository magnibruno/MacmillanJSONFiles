The festival is more than 3,000 years old. It’s amazing, and really colorful – I love it! The people don’t wear traditional clothes, but they eat traditional food, like mooncakes. They are small, round cakes and they’re delicious! You can see dancers in colorful costumes perform traditional dances. There are also lots of paper lanterns with bright patterns. People light them to say thank you for children, who make everyone so happy – most of the time! So far, this birthday is one of the best ever!"
