It’s just like in any other city, except it’s impossible to stay outside for too long. ‘Yes, it’s very cold, but I like it here,’ says Nina. She’s wearing a big fur hat, boots and a long coat, but she’s smiling. ‘Humans can survive anywhere,’ she says."

It’s the world’s most remote inhabited island. The weather is a little windy, but this isn’t the problem. There isn’t an airport, and the nearest mainland is South Africa, 2,430 km away. To get to the island, there’s a boat from Cape Town. The journey takes six days. So, how do people survive on this island? Well, there’s electricity and the internet. There’s a grocery store, too, but food is expensive, so most people on the island grow potatoes. Why do people stay when life isn’t easy? Erik, a worker at the fish factory, says, ‘It’s so quiet and beautiful. We don’t have the problems of the modern world here’."

Because it’s 50°C and nobody wants to be outside. The weather here is extreme. In the summer, it’s hotter than the Sahara Desert. But this isn’t the driest place on Earth – that’s the Atacama Desert in Chile. In fact, there are a lot of thunderstorms in the fall. What do people do here, then? During the hottest months, they live inside. Most people drive from their air-conditioned homes in their air-conditioned cars to air-conditioned offices and shopping malls. And there is another important thing. ‘Water, water, water,’ says Sharifa, an architect. ‘We have to drink a lot!’"
