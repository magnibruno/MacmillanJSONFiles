All houses will be metal and everything will be shiny. Cars won't drive on roads; they will fly in the air. People won't walk because they will fly around with jetpacks instead. People won't get sick, hungry or thirsty. And they won't need to get money or have a job. Robots will do everything. They will take care of the people and get them everything they need. In stores, there will be robot sales clerks. Children will get to school on their jetpacks. At school, there won't be desks. Every student will have a computer. The teachers will be robots.
